      <h1>An overview of the interning idea here at LEAD</h1>
      <p>The LEAD internship class would be like Design Thinking and Emerging LEADers, a LEAD exclusive class that allows students to go into their particular career interests. This will help LEAD get even more of a leading edge as it's only available to freshman and sophomores at Park Hill.</p>

      <p>This can be very helpful to just about everyone who uses it. If students get into the real work environment it can help them get insight on their job, as well as introduce them to new career types and possibilities. Having internships at LEAD just seems natural, LEAD innovation studio is well, innovative. So having something like interning would be the innovative way to help students understand what workplaces and careers are REALLY like. Students can also get paid for internships. According to Glassdoor the average salary for a high school intern is 12$ hourly, of course, it depends on the job and other variables but it's still more than minimum wage and connecting with professionals in professional spaces... As a teenager. In fact, there are so skills you gain or at least begin to understand/learn...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Adaptability -</b> Employers like people and look for those who can adapt to changes, this is a life skill in general as well as in our lives we experience many changes whether that be just this weekend when I moved to a new house instead of an apartment, or there is a new student at our school. Adaptation is very much a necessity for human expansion and success in every aspect of life.</li>
        <li><b>Respect -</b> When I say respect I don't mean like going all Japanese feudalism style and going all formal all the time but more like being able to understand and respect others opinions. When you are working professionally with a group it is vital that you are able to communicate on a professional level. If you allow your differences get the best of your work, you are destined to fail or not reach your projects maximum potential.</li>
        <li><b>Communication -</b> Communication is essential and really there isn't much need for me to talk about it, being able to have a strong knowledgeable claim and know what you are talking while accepting other viewpoints is a virtue that I can very strongly say will help us. This ability is practiced especially in internships and workplaces. When talking to an adult in your career who is extremely experienced you learn a lot, but being able to show your competence in the industry as just a student is very formidable. Most adults will not think the highest of you so it isn't hard if you really try to astonish them.</li>
<ul>
      <p>I have vested a lot of time in the project and I even have a form running so I can get intel on what types of careers to start contacting for this.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Most of the websites I researched just gave some of the basic knowledge of what an internship and inter is. They gave off mainly the advantages and how much effective they are depending on what age. The Intern Group site goes minorly into detail about each age group whereas the article by Chron focuses on how some jobs are illegal for minors to access, it also gives an overview of companies and the set age requirements. The final source I viewed was from a website called Eye of the Intern (pretty fitting), this website goes over mainly how to get an intern at any age, such as thinking locally and look for ones that contribute to college credit.</p>

      <h2 id="blockquotes">Quote from TheInternGroup</h2>

      <blockquote><p> An internship while youâ€™re in high school will set you apart from your peers. Not many students at this age have proper work experience so this will give you an edge compared to other students who only have exam grades to show potential colleges and universities on applications.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>What I gained from these interviews</h2>
        <p><b>John K -</b> Through my talk with John Kreicberg, I gathered lots of intel and opinions from what he thought was acceptable for an intern. Overall John was very much for the idea and of interning and self teaching and taking action while not living by others rules. He explained specifically on how this related to jobs, web development and coding in general takes a very non-traditional way of gathering info and seeing if you are worthy or not in interviews, most of the time these companies check your portfolio for your creations, it gives them a good idea of you skillset and potential in their company.</p>
        <p><b>Dr. Stanley -</b> I gathered a lot of info, he seemed like he was all for it, he gave me some names to contact as far as professional studies goes so that will be more interviews. People like Ms. Barner are here at LEAD so that will be easy. I also figured out that making a class is going to be a long tedious success that has a low chance of becoming a thing, but I can push this into the sprig project if I can get in touch with businesses around Kansas City. </p>
        <p><b>Mr. Motta -</b> Overall from the interview with Mr. Motta I gathered that he was yet again extremely for the idea of having interning at LEAD, this time he was more about having design thinking be that bridge to internships and getting a class, I was also able to understand his hopes for the second semester project and what he hopes for students to accomplish. I got a lot of valuable answers and yet again I seek to push my idea of an internship class or club here at LEAD even further, moving onto some of the professional studies teachers next.</p>
